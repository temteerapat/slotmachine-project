Running a JS program from the command line is handled by NodeJS. Start by installing NodeJS on local machine if necessary.

## Install Node.js
Now simply open the command line in the same directory as the project.js script you created (VS Code will do this automatically with the integrated terminal).
## Run JavaScript from the Command Line
```javascript
node .

// or 

node project.js
```
